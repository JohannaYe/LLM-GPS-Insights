# LLM-GPS-Insights
GPS-LLM-Insights is a project that combines large language models (LLMs) with GPS trajectory data analysis. By leveraging the natural language processing capabilities of LLMs, this project aims to provide deep insights and valuable information from GPS trajectory data. 

# Main Features
- GPS Trajectory Data Processing: Extract useful features and patterns from raw GPS data.
- Natural Language Processing: Use large language models to generate descriptions and analyses of GPS trajectory data.
- Data Visualization: Provide intuitive charts and maps to help users better understand the data.
- Intelligent Insights: Utilize the reasoning capabilities of large language models to provide intelligent insights and recommendations about GPS trajectory data.
# Tech Stack
- Large Language Models (LLMs): Use the latest natural language processing models for data analysis and generation.
- GPS Data Processing: Utilize Python and related libraries (such as Pandas, GeoPandas) for data processing and analysis.
- Data Visualization: Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization.
- Map Display: Utilize libraries like Folium, Leaflet for map display.
